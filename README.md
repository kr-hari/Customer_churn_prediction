# Customer Churn Prediction

Accurately predicting customer retention is a crucial undertaking for companies. The following are some benefits associated with this task: 

- Retaining Revenue: Predicting customer churn helps companies retain revenue by proactively addressing at-risk customers.
- Improving Customer Satisfaction: Churn prediction allows companies to identify and resolve factors contributing to customer dissatisfaction.
- Optimizing Marketing Strategies: Churn prediction enables targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers to retain customers.
- Resource Allocation: Identifying likely churners helps allocate resources efficiently, focusing efforts on high-value customers.
- Competitive Advantage: Effective churn prediction differentiates companies, fosters loyalty, and reduces churn rates.

This project is a result of my particiapation in a hackathon where I ended up being the top 5 participant. Over here, I try to predict the cutomers of a B2B company who will churn based on their participation, which is observed through number of inquiries,  social media views / likes, number of consultations, interaction with documents etc...

There were several challenges including but not limited to highly skewed dataset, smaller size of dataset, large number of categorical features etc... which has been addressed in the project. I hope this wil serve as an example for similar projects.
