# Customer Churn Prediction

Accurately predicting customer retention is a crucial undertaking for companies. The following are some benefits associated with this task: 

- Retaining Revenue: Predicting customer churn helps companies retain revenue by proactively addressing at-risk customers.
- Improving Customer Satisfaction: Churn prediction allows companies to identify and resolve factors contributing to customer dissatisfaction.
- Optimizing Marketing Strategies: Churn prediction enables targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers to retain customers.
- Resource Allocation: Identifying likely churners helps allocate resources efficiently, focusing efforts on high-value customers.
- Competitive Advantage: Effective churn prediction differentiates companies, fosters loyalty, and reduces churn rates.

I developed this project after participating in a hackathon, where I achieved a top 5 ranking. The project focuses on predicting customer churn for a B2B company by analyzing various factors such as the number of inquiries, social media views/likes, consultations, and interaction with documents.

The project encountered several challenges, including but not limited to a highly skewed dataset, a smaller dataset size, and a large number of categorical features. However, these challenges have been effectively addressed within the project. I believe that this project can serve as a valuable example for similar projects facing similar obstacles.
